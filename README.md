This project manages databases by processing multiple orders placed by multiple clients. Adding, deleting, updating and viewing the entire table can be done on the customer and product tables. In the case of orders, we have operations for adding, deleting, updating and viewing all orders (CRUD operations). The project is structured in 4 packages: Model classes (which represent data models of the application), Business Logic classes (contain the application logic), Presentation classes (GUI), Data access classes (classes the access to the database). I used SQL as a language and MySQL Workbench as a tool.
